              Front-end development, also known as client-side development, has
              a long and evolving history. Here are some key milestones in the
              history of front-end development:
              <br />
              1. The early days of the web (1990s): In the early days of the
              web, front-end development consisted of creating simple HTML pages
              that could be displayed in web browsers. CSS (Cascading Style
              Sheets) was introduced in 1996, allowing developers to separate
              the presentation of a web page from its content.
              <br />
              2. The rise of JavaScript (late 1990s): In the late 1990s,
              JavaScript emerged as a key front-end technology, allowing
              developers to create dynamic, interactive web pages. This was also
              the era of the first web frameworks, such as Backbone.js and
              AngularJS.

          <div class="box" id="Vision">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-2">Vision</h3>
            <p class="sm:px-0 mt-2 px-2">
              1. Building engaging and intuitive user interfaces: One key
              element of your vision might be to create interfaces that are
              engaging and intuitive for users. This could involve incorporating
              animations, microinteractions, and other design elements that help
              users understand how to interact with your site or app.
              <br />
              2. Emphasizing accessibility and inclusivity: Another important
              component of your vision might be to create interfaces that are
              accessible and inclusive for all users. This could involve
              following accessibility guidelines, using semantic HTML, and
              testing your interfaces with assistive technology.
              <br />
              3. Staying up-to-date with new technologies: As a front-end
              developer, you need to stay current with new technologies and
              frameworks as they emerge. Your vision might include a commitment
              to ongoing learning and professional development, whether through
              attending conferences, taking online courses, or participating in
              local meetups.

          <div class="box" id="Goals">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-2">Goals</h3>
            <p class="sm:px-0 mt-2 px-2">
              1. Becoming proficient in a particular front-end technology: One
              goal could be to become an expert in a particular front-end
              technology, such as React, Vue, or Angular. This can involve
              deepening your understanding of the technology, mastering its
              features and best practices, and building a portfolio of projects
              that demonstrate your skills. <br />
              2. Building a strong design sense: Another goal might be to
              develop a strong design sense, which can help you create visually
              appealing and user-friendly interfaces. This can involve studying
              design principles, working on your visual design skills, and
              collaborating with designers to improve your designs. <br />
              3. Creating accessible and inclusive user experiences: As a
              front-end developer, you have the power to create interfaces that
              are inclusive and accessible to a wide range of users. One goal
              could be to become an expert in accessibility and inclusive
              design, and to advocate for these principles in your work.
